###steps
          
Step 1: 

Install dependencies for the full-stack project
Navigate to the root folder and install the project dependencies.

D:\user\spotify-full-stack> npm install


Step 2: 

Set up the backend
Navigate to the backend folder.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-backend
Install backend dependencies.

D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-backend> npm install
Start the backend server.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-backend> node server.js
The backend server will usually run on http://localhost:5000 or a similar port, depending on your server.js configuration.


Step 3: 

Run the frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-frontend
Run the frontend development server.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-frontend> npm run dev
The frontend server should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port is specified in the frontend config).

"welcome to spotify"    
             login 
       user name : user
       
       password  : 1234     


Step 4: 

Set up the admin panel
Navigate to the admin folder.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-admin
Install the admin panel dependencies.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-admin> npm install
Run the admin panel development server.


D:\user\spotify-full-stack\spotify-admin> npm run dev
The admin panel server will likely run on http://localhost:4000 (or a custom port as specified in the admin config).

Final Overview

Backend: http://localhost:5000 (or your backend port)
Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (or your frontend port)
Admin: http://localhost:4000 (or your admin panel port)
